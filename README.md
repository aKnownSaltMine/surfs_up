## Overview
Weather is a key factor to take into effect when making plans to open up a surf shop. If weather is too unpredictible it could lead to unpredictable tourist/and surfer traffic to the area, endangering consistent revenue. To help prepare for this, We were able to examine weather data taken daily across the island of Ohahu from the years 2010 to 2017, previously examining the precipitation on the island, but now examining the temperature on the extremes of the year.
